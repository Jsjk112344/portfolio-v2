    subtitle: "Your Guide to Giving - Mobile Navigation App for Food Delivery Volunteers",
    overview: "PathPilot is a comprehensive mobile navigation app designed to assist food delivery volunteers with intelligent route planning using Google Maps API. The app addresses the critical challenge of volunteers being unfamiliar with delivery locations and provides an integrated solution for efficient meal delivery to beneficiaries through optimized routing, real-time navigation, and emergency support features.",
    
    motivation: {
      title: "Why I Built PathPilot",
      content: "During my active involvement in hall volunteering activities at NUS, I observed a recurring problem: volunteers delivering meals to the elderly often struggled with navigation and route efficiency. The current standard operating procedure involves charitable organizations providing volunteers with basic address lists, leaving them to figure out directions independently using consumer map applications. However, modern map apps like Google Maps don't support multi-location routing via public transport, forcing volunteers to manually compare up to 2 addresses at once to determine optimal paths. This inefficiency not only wastes valuable time but also leads to meals arriving cold and volunteers becoming discouraged. Recognizing this gap, I developed PathPilot as a comprehensive solution to streamline the volunteering process, reduce delivery times, and potentially attract more people to volunteer for such meaningful causes."
